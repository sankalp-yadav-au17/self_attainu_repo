<!--Create an HTML document which satisfies the following 
conditions: 
1.  It should have a page “title” and a top level heading. 
2.  It should have multiple paragraphs organized properly with 
sub level headings. 
3.  It should have bold, italic and underlined text/content. 
4.  It should have at least two links to another webpage (local or 
external), one opening in the same tab and another opening 
in a different tab. 
5.  It should include a (description/ordered/unordered/) list. 
Note: 
 The content inside the heading and paragraph tags are 
irrelevant. The task is to have various HTML tags taught. 
However, you can put real content instead of dummy text if 
you want. -->

            "<strong>Wake up to reality!</strong> Nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed world. The longer you
            live, the more you realize that the only things that truly exist in this reality are merely
            pain, suffering and futility. Listen, everywhere you look in this world, wherever there is light,
            there will always be shadows to be found as well. As long as there is a concept of victors, the vanquished will also exist. The selfish intent of wanting 
            to preserve peace, initiates war, and hatred is born in order to protect love. There are nexuses casual relationships 
            that cannot be separated."

            “Sometimes you must hurt in order to know, fall in order to grow, lose in order to grow because life's greatest struggle in through the pain.” 
            <u>“Pain is the way to bring peace.”</u>> “Justice comes from vengeance but justice only breeds more vengeance.” “Just by living, people hurt others 
            without even realizing it."
