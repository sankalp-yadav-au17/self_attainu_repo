(Easy)
In a town, there are n people labelled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of
these people is secretly the town judge.If the town judge exists, then:
1. The town judge trusts nobody.
2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
You are given trust, an array of pairs trust[i] = [a, b] representing that the person
labelled a trusts the person labelled b.
If the town judge exists and can be identified, return the label of the town judge.
Otherwise, return -1.
Example 1:
Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2
Example 2:
Input: n = 3'''
n=3
trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
