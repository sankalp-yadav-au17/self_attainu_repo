'''Q-3) Find Center of Star Graph
(5 marks)
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-center-of-star-graph/
(Easy)
There is an undirected star graph consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n. A
star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly n - 1 edges that
connect the center node with every other node.
You are given a 2D integer array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates
that there is an edge between the nodes ui and vi. Return the center of the given
star graph.
Example 1:Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other
node, so 2 is the center.
